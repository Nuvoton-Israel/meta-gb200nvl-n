Subject: [PATCH 07/11] i2c: npcm: Enable slave in eob interrupt

Nuvoton slave enable was in user space API call master_xfer, so it is
subject to delays from the OS scheduler. If the BMC is not enabled for
slave mode in time for master to send response, then it will NAK the
address match. Then the PLDM request timeout occurs.

If the slave enable is moved to the EOB interrupt service routine, then
the BMC can be ready in slave mode by the time it needs to receive a
response.
