Upstream-Status: Pending [Not submitted to upstream yet]

Subject: [PATCH 04/11] i2c: npcm: Modify timeout evaluation mechanism

The users want to connect a lot of masters on the same bus.
This timeout is used to determine the time it takes to take bus ownership.
The transactions are very long, so waiting 35ms is not enough.

Increase the timeout and treat it as the total timeout, including retries.
The total timeout is 2 seconds now.

The i2c core layer will have chances to retry to call the i2c driver
transfer function if the i2c driver reports that the bus is busy and
returns -EAGAIN.
